              Jacob Burnap, Merrimack's first settled minister, were the town's 
              first business women. Elizabeth (who later married Hon. Joseph Read, 
              Ruth, Hannah (who married Samuel Buel), Rebecca, Abigail, Susan, 
              and Lucy (who married Hon. Joseph Read) discovered a special kind 
              of grass they called &quot;Dunstable Straw&quot; and wove it to 
              create beautiful &quot;Leghorn hats.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              <i>According to a history written in 1946 by Mattie (Kilborn) Webster</i>: 
              &quot;Some of these bonnets were of black leghorn straw trimmed 
              with peach colored crepe, and crowned with a beautiful bouquet of 
              half-blown roses, lilacs and field flowers. They were often ornamented 
              with a bow of ribbon, long ends or streamers on one side. A bouquet 
              of wild poppies was sometimes placed in front surmounted by a plume 
              of marabout feathers. The ribbon was either straw colored or striped. 
              A little later the style changed. Pieces of brim was cut away at 
              the back and drawn up at the crown with a large bow. Strings and 
              rosettes were over the right ear. Some were sold in Boston for as 
              much as $50. John Stark bought one for his wife Molly. They not 
              only made bonnets but other things from grass or plated straw.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Norfolk County Advertiser, August 1821. Reprinted in Boston Commercial 
              Gazette (Boston MA), 2 August 1821, Volume 58, Issue 10, page 1.<i> 
              &quot;On Monday last was sold at auction at Merchant's Hall the 
              elegant Bonnet which has been for several days exhibited at the 
              store of Messrs. Hall J. Howe &amp; Co., made by Misses Bernaps 
              of Merrimack, N.H., of a wild grass discovered by them in that town. 
              It was knocked off to Josiah Bradlee for Fifty Dollars. The execution 
              of the Bonnet was very superior to the one lately sent to England 
              from Connecticut. We understand that one of the above mentioned 
              young ladies is now visiting at Medford and that the money was presented 
              to her yesterday afternoon. Thus shall the skill and industry of 
              our countrywomen ever be rewarded</i>.&quot;</font></font></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#993333"><font color="#000000">

              Although Merrimack claimed the first bonnet of this type, a Sophia 
              Woodhouse of Wethersfield Connecticut, who had a similar business, 
              patented her design in 1821.<br>

                who was attacked while making turpentine in the woods, and taken 
                captive by the Indians. <br>

                She graduated from the Manchester High School in1868. She was 
                elected to serve as an assistant teacher for the intermediate 
                school the following year. In 1870, after attending training institutes, 
                the Manchester School Committee awarded her a teaching certificate 
                for the intermediate school, entitling her to a position as a 
                full teacher. She remained in that position until 1875, when she 
                gave up her job to help her parents set up a farm in Merrimack, 
                NH. </font></p>

              to the Legislature and had devoted much of his time to the growth

              Merrimack's first volunteer fire department in 1924. At the organizational 
              meeting of the department Josiah N. Henderson was elected Chief 
              and Arthur G. Gordon its Deputy Chief which office he held until 
              his retirement in 1949. He served the town as its forest fire warden 
              for many years. His interest in the growth and development of Merrimack 
              were not confined to the Fire Department alone. He devoted much 
              of his time to the Last Rest Cemetery Association, Wheeler Chapel, 
              to the industrial aspects of the Town's growth, and was, at the 
              time of his death, Senior Deacon of the Merrimack Congregational 
              Church. The Town's new fire station will long serve as a memorial

                Merrimack, April 4 -- Mrs. Bertha (Lowell) Gordon, life-long resident

                recently Mrs. Gordon gave the Arthur G. Gordon Memorial Fire Station 
                in memory of her husband, and it was also through her interest

                Griffin</b> was the daughter of George Byron &amp; Sarah Frances 
                (Spalding) Griffin of Merrimack NH. She was born on May 4, 1874 
                in Merrimack, New Hampshire and died February 3, 1968 at Memorial 
                Hospital in Nashua NH. Her father was a local grocer, and she 
                was one of three daughters born into this family. They lived on 
                a farm located on the Daniel Webster Highway (in the location 
                of the current Residence and Comfort Inns). She is buried in Reeds 
                Cemetery on Camp Sargent Road.<br>
                <br>
                She lived her entire life in the town of Merrimack, very much 
                interested in the welfare of her neighbors. At one point she learned 
                that the local school band did not have enough funds to attend 
                a national competition, and she provided them. Upon her death 
                it was learned she had established trust funds through her will 
                to assist the town, Merrimack residents who could not afford health 
                care, offer scholarships to local young people for college, and 
                funds for the police and fire departments. Those funds continue 
                to benefit Merrimack residents today.<br>
                <br>
                On September 12, 1996, on Merrimack's 250th anniversary, the Board 
                of Selectmen named the bandstand area, near the town hall, the 
                &quot;Abbie Griffin Park&quot; in her honor. (The bandstand area 
                was made possible by the generous financial donations of local 
                residents, business owners and volunteers). This park is a gathering 
                place for Merrimack's musical and social events.<br>

              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Giacamo Mastrocola 
              aka <b>James Mastricola</b> was born 27 March 1878 in Casacalenda, 
              Italy. He immigrated to Montreal, Canada when he was 17 years old, 
              working on the railroad. Afterwards moving to Nashua NH, he sold 
              fruit from a pushcart with his brother, Peter. (Peter was killed 
              in an accident in 1925, aged 53). </font> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After many 
                years of hard work, James Mastricola was able to buy a farm in 
                Merrimack, New Hampshire where he then lived for over 50 years. 
                When he died at age 80 on 6 March 1958 it was learned that he 
                had invested well, accumulating the small fortune of $143,000. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Never having 
                had formal schooling, he valued education, and in his will he 
                left his estate to the town of Merrimack to build a school. First 
                used as a high school, the James Mastricola School became Merrimack's 
                junior high school in 1966. In 1973 after more construction was 
                completed, the school was renamed the James Mastricola Middle 
                School in his honor. Today there are two schools named after Mr. 
                Mastricola: James Mastricola Elementary School 7 School Street, 
                and James Mastricola Upper Elementary School, 26 Baboosic Lake 
                Road, both in Merrimack NH.<br>
                <br>
                A portrait of James Mastricola hangs in the school today, inspiring 
                all who look at it, of a man who had great faith in his adopted 
                country. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                Nashua Corporation is now located on the property of the Mastricola 
                farm.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Maggi Parker</b> 
                was born in Nashua, New Hampshire in 1927, the daughter of Charles 
                R. &amp; Susan B. (Patterson) Parker. She was raised in her parent's 
                home on Boston Post Road in South Merrimack, New Hampshire. It 
                appears that at an early age she was an individualist, plotting 
                a unique path. In a 1969 TV Guide article She related: &quot;Nobody 
                smokes and drinks in my family but me.&quot; In her younger days 
                at home, whenever she came in late, her mother took a branch off 
                a lilac bush and hit her with it. &quot;After age 12, there wasn't 
                much left of that lilac bush,&quot; Maggi said. In a later article 
                her father Charles says that the line about the lilac bush was 
                a &quot;wee bit exaggerated,&quot; but agreed that she and her 
                brother were raised in a strict household.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Her work as 
                an educator is impressive. In addition to teaching school in New 
                England, she traveled and was principal on an airbase in Japan. 
                Then she traveled to Madrid, Spain, where she taught school. From 
                there she became a principal of a school of the American School 
                for Air Force Dependant Children on the Island of Mallorca. Her 
                focus and expertise turned to education for emotionally disturbed 
                children and young adults. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1969 Maggie 
                attributed her success as a teacher to her interest in acting. 
                Although she majored in education at Keene State College in her 
                native New Hampshire and at Boston University, she also studied 
                drama, and she says, &quot;Love of the theater made me a good 
                teacher. Can you imagine Bob Hope as a teacher? Kids would flock 
                to his classes - it's the stimulation.&quot; </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> She moved 
                to Los Angeles to work on her doctorate at the University of Southern 
                California. . There she was U.S. Assistant Professor of Education 
                at California State University, Los Angeles session-Summer Session. 
                She was there to study school administration, but instead married 
                in 1963 and the following year moved to a location she fell in 
                love with-Hawaii. Although she has continued to live in that island 
                paradise for 49 years, she has visited New Hampshire several times 
                to attend alumni celebrations for Keene State College (as recently 
                at 2008), and also to travel in Europe (including Ireland; a river 
                ship--The Bizet, in Vienna, sailing up the Danube, Main, and Rhine 
                rivers for 14 days to Amsterdam).<br>

                for the Iolani Palace, and was on the board of the Kawananakoa 
                Foundation until 1998. In September 1970 she escorted Princess

                <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Perhaps our 
                most well-know notable was the great Indian sachem, Passaconaway 
                (&quot;child of the bear&quot;), leader of all the native Americans 
                inhabiting the Merrimack Valley.</FONT> 
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a treaty 
                  with the General Court of Massachusetts on April 9, 1662, Passaconaway 
                  formally made peace with the &quot;white man&quot; and was granted 
                  a tract of land in Merrimack 3 miles long and 1 and a half miles 
                  wide north of the Souhegan River. This tract included the two 
                  river island of Minnehaha and Minnewawa. The formal request 
                  made to Governor Endicott of Massachusetts was granted for 25 
                  English pounds. The request is in the Massachusetts Archives. 
                  A few years later this same piece of land was granted to an 
                  Englishman.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was rumored 
                  that Passaconaway lived well past the age of 100 and possessed 
                  magical powers. He was reported to have made water burn and 
                  sticks turn into snakes. His treaty with the whites was prompted 
                  by a vision with the &quot;Great Spirit&quot; who foretold their 
                  great numbers.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Passaconaway 
                  was believed to have fathered seven children. His second son 
                  but third child, Wonalancet was his successor as leader of his 
                  tribe. One of his daughters, Weetamo also had important positions 
                  of leadership within the tribe.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On his death 
                  the legend has it that he was carried off to heaven from the 
                  top of a white mountain on a sled drawn by wolves.<a name="MasonRaymond"></a></font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Louis Sperry 
                  was born in Lincoln County, Kansas on March 16, 1908. He was 
                  the second of eight children (five boys, three girls). Sperry 
                  attended Sylvan Grove High School in Kansas, where he participated 
                  in football, basketball, and track. He would have liked to play 
                  baseball, but the school did not have a team. His first year 
                  of high school, his father would not permit him to play football 
                  because he was too small and worried he would get hurt. During 
                  his second year of high school, the football coach sat down 
                  with his father and convinced him Louis could play. The football 
                  team had a shortage of pads, so he had to use the pads of the 
                  players sitting on the bench. In some cases he used pads from 
                  some of the larger guys on the team, which made the pads stick 
                  out past his body on each side. He graduated from Sylvan Grove 
                  in 1927.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He married 
                  his first wife Pauline, with whom he later had one child who 
                  died at birth.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His first 
                  paying job was working for his uncle Lynn driving horses. For 
                  10 days worth of work he received 3 stacks worth of quarters, 
                  with each one totaling $2.00 at his best guess. His first impression 
                  was the great amount of money it represented.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Louis took 
                  a job on a three-square cattle farm in Kansas, which equates 
                  to three square miles of territory he had to cover. He worked 
                  through the dust bowl. Mr. Sperry recalls dust storms so severe, 
                  someone lighting a cigarette 3 feet away looked like a flicker 
                  of light miles in the distance. Mr. Sperry also worked odd jobs 
                  for the railroad, which included track repair and worked in 
                  a rock quarry. He then moved to Washington State, where he took 
                  a job shucking oysters.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 
                  depression Louis would often catch animals to sell their furs 
                  for extra money. When he'd catch skunks he would keep them in 
                  a pit until mid december when their pelts would be at their 
                  thickest before claiming their hides.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1939, 
                  Mr. Sperry moved to New York City, where he sold pharmaceutical 
                  supplies to treat asthma. He then took a job in construction 
                  on Long Island, NY. He also worked at this time in restaurants 
                  as a cook.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1942, 
                  Louis Sperry enrolled in the Marines to serve his country. His 
                  troop was being prepared to be the fifth wave to invade Tokyo. 
                  However, the bombing of Japan by U.S. forces cancelled this 
                  mission. During his time in the Marines, he also served as a 
                  cook.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After World 
                  War II, Mr. Sperry moved to New Hampshire while he courted his 
                  second wife Bessie. When he first settled into Merrimack, he 
                  lived in a rooming house later known as Hannah Jack's Tavern. 
                  At this time he worked for Bessie's family selling pharmaceuticals. 
                  He and Bessie married and had four children together. Around 
                  1949, Louis, his brother-in-law Bob Snapp, and family friend 
                  Lenny Berry built the home he still lives in today on D.W. Highway.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After selling 
                  pharmaceuticals, Louis took a position with Hood manufacturing 
                  ice cream in their plant in Manchester,NH. When Hood closed 
                  the plant, Hood reassigned all of its workers. When asked what 
                  position he wanted to transfer into, Sperry decided he wanted 
                  to take a position repairing refrigeration units. Hood asked, 
                  &quot;Do you know how?&quot; and Sperry responded &quot;No, 
                  but do any of your employees come through the door with refrigeration 
                  repair skills?&quot; Hood replied &quot;No, so you can have 
                  the job.&quot; The new job took Louis to Boston, where he commuted 
                  for a number of years from Merrimack daily. One day, he was 
                  called in and transferred back to Manchester, where he completed 
                  his career with Hood until age 65, when he was forced to retire.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He continued 
                  to work in refrigeration repair through agencies for several 
                  more years. He then went on to work as a cook in a restaurant 
                  in Pembroke. He finally retired in 1995 after working at Alexandria's 
                  supermarkets (now Hannaford) collecting shopping carts.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When asked 
                  what Merrimack has become in his time here, he recalls watching 
                  D.W. Highway grow up around him. When asked what is the one 
                  thing he wants Merrimack to know from him, he replied &quot;Merrimack 
                  is full of really nice people.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For all 
                  of Louis Sperry's hard work and loving life, he had much to 
                  show for it. He enjoyed his gardens and made wind chimes. Also 
                  In addition to his four children with Bessie, he left behind 
                  eight grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.</font></p>

                S. Thornton was born in Thornton's Ferry (Merrimack), NH on February 
                25, 1827. He was the great-grandson of Matthew Thornton, signer 
                of the Declaration of Independence. His father James B. Thornton 
                died in 1838, while ambassador to Peru. His upbringing was taken 
                over by future US president Franklin Pierce and Senator Atherton.

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On January 
                  15, 1841, at the age of 14, James was appointed a midshipman 
                  in the United States Navy by Senator Atherton. He served on 
                  the frigate Columbia and John Adams, a sloop converted to a 
                  man-of-war. In 1846 hew was sent to the Naval Academy and in 
                  1847 to sea during the war with Mexico.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1850 
                  James Thornton was engaged in coast survey work in the Pacific 
                  and after a dispute with his superior resigned from the Navy. 
                  He spent the next three years surveying the gold fields of California 
                  and in what is now Utah.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In February 
                  1854 he was restored to his naval rank and went to sea aboard 
                  the store-ship Relief serving in the waters around South America. 
                  While on this duty he was wounded fighting a duel.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1857, 
                  James Thornton returned to Merrimack and married his cousin, 
                  Ellen Thornton Wood. The couple would have no children.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the outbreak 
                  of the Civil War Thornton, who was serving on the brig Bainbridge, 
                  was transferred to Admiral David Farragut's flagship Hartford 
                  as executive officer. He was aboard the Hartford during the 
                  capture of New Orleans and served on this ship in subsequent 
                  campaigns on the Mississippi River, including Vicksburg. It 
                  was while aboard the Hartford that Thornton devised the scheme 
                  to cover the sides of the ship with chains to repel cannon balls. 
                  He received high praise from Farragut for the idea.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In August 
                  1862 Thornton became commander of gunboat Winona which was stationed 
                  off Mobile, Alabama. In December 1862 he was assigned as executive 
                  officer the Kearsarge at the start of her cruise in search of 
                  the Confederate raider. The battle between the Kearsarge and 
                  the Alabama is one of the famous naval battles in American history. 
                  The engagement took place in June, 1864 off the coast of France. 
                  The commanding officer of the Kearsarge, Captain John Winslow, 
                  in a report to Gideon Wells, the Secretary of War, singled out 
                  Thornton's performance:</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It 
                  would seem almost invidious to particularize the conduct of 
                  any one man or officer in which all had done their duty with 
                  a fortitude and coolness which can not be too highly praised, 
                  but I feel it due to my executive officer, Lieutenant. Commander 
                  Thornton, who superintended the working of the battery, to particularly 
                  mention him for an example of coolness and encouragement of 
                  the men while fighting, which contributed much toward the success 
                  of the action.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of 
                  the crew also credited Thornton with playing a major role in 
                  the battle. The sinking of the Alabama was a major defeat for 
                  the Confederate States and a major victory for the United States. 
                  Thornton's naval career was undoubtedly helped by his participation 
                  in the fight. For distinguished service in action, James Thornton 
                  received a Congressional vote of thanks and was advanced over 
                  others in his grade and given command of the Kearsarge.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the 
                  war, he was stationed at the Portsmouth Navy Yard from 1865 
                  to 1873 where he was promoted to the rank of Captain in 1872.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1873 
                  Captain Thornton was given command of the USS Monongahela for 
                  a scientific expedition to Kerguelen's Land. The voyage was 
                  undertaken with only the original charts made by Captain Cook. 
                  His mission was a success but on the return voyage he was thrown 
                  down by a sudden lurch of the ship and received a serious injury 
                  to his spine. At Cape Town South Africa, he was sent home by 
                  way of England. After being transported to Philadelphia, Captain 
                  Thornton died at Germantown, PA on May 14, 1875 at the age of 
                  48. His body was returned to Merrimack and he was buried in 
                  Last Rest Cemetery. The US Navy recognized his distinguished 
                  service by naming the torpedo boat, &quot;The Thornton&quot; 
                  in his honor.</font></p>

                Thornton was born in Ireland about 1714. In his lifetime, Matthew 
                Thornton was president of the Provincial Convention in 1775, was 
                the 1776 New Hampshire delegate to Congress, was judge of the 
                Superior Court of New Hampshire (he was a self-taught lawyer),

                  War, and as one of New Hampshire's delegates to sign the Declaration 
                  of Independence. He was in his 60's when he served as a surgeon

                  family to Merrimack. He settled on the farm formerly owned by 
                  Edward Lutwyche and operated the ferry. From this time on the 
                  ferry was called Thornton's Ferry, and that section of town 
                  is still referred to as Thornton's Ferry. Matthew Thornton's 
                  home was a large three story house with peaked roof. It stood 
                  on the bank of the Merrimack River near the railroad tracks. 
                  It was torn down about 1840 when the railroad depot was built.</font></p>
