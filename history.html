                was originally the home of the Penacook Indians. These Native 
                Americans were part of a confederacy of Algonquin tribes that 
                occupied the basin of the Merrimack River and adjacent regions 
                in New Hampshire. They called this area &quot;Natukhog&quot; or 
                Naticook. The word &quot;Merrimack&quot; comes from an Abenaki 
                term meaning either &quot;the place of strong current&quot; or 
                &quot;a sturgeon.&quot;</font></i></FONT></P>
              <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><font color="#000000">European 
                colonists settled here as early at 1655. In that year the Massachusetts 
                General Court laid out land in current-day Merrimack to the town 
                of Billerica, and John Cromwell is mentioned as having a trading 
                house here. He built a house on the bank of the Merrimack River 
                about a mile below Thornton's Ferry. The next permanent settler 
                is believed to be Jonas Barrett in 1722.<br>
                <br>
                In 1658 the town became part of 'Brenton's Farm,&quot; and even 
                later, became a part of the town of Dunstable. In 1734 the General 
                Court of Massachusetts separated and granted the Town under the 
                name of Naticook (which included the current-day town of Litchfield 
                and the southern part of Merrimack). In 1741 the boundary line 
                dispute between Massachsetts and New Hampshire was settled, changing 
                several township boundary lines. On April 2, 1746 a petition was 
                granted which incorporated &quot;Merrymac&quot;--the current Town 
                of Merrimack.</font></i></FONT></P>

                Hill and Meetinghouse Roads. This was considered the first Town 
                center. The west wing of Merrimack's current town hall was built 
                in 1872.</font></i></FONT></P>

                Hill), and at least ninety-four men participated between 1775-1783. 
                Reuben Cummings, a sixteen-year-old drummer was the only Merrimack 
                soldier known to have died during that war, on September 13, 1776.

                  The Merrimack Historical Society was organized at the Merrimack 
                  Public Library in June, 1970. The purpose of the Society was 
                  to collect and preserve history and artifacts of Merrimack. 
                  The interim slate of officers listed Beulah Haseltine as president, 
                  George Michael as vice president, Alice Dutton as secretary, 
                  Franklin Haseltine as treasurer and Cynthia Jones doing publicity. 
                  At that time they had a Board of Directors, consisting of William 
                  McShea, Electa Pearson, Charles Nute, Ethel Smith and Charles 
                  Morrill. They held their first official meeting in September, 
                  1970. At that time, the interim slate of officers became official. 
                  They met at the Library or in private homes.</FONT></P>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1971, 
                  they began work on Volume I of The History of Merrymac, under 
                  the leadership of Joyce Bishop. They published this book in 
                  1976, and included the early history of our town through 1800. 
                  Volume II is currently being written.</font></p>

                  1988, the Society acquired the 1847 Schoolhouse #12 on the Boston 
                  Post Road in South Merrimack. Since the school itself closed 
                  in 1947, the building was in use by the South Merrimack Community 
                  Club. A major project was involved before opening to the public 
                  in 1990, under the direction of Phil Crosier and a large working 
                  crew. This involved refinishing floors, replacing walls and 
                  ceilings, installing a furnace and air conditioning, and water

                to John and Isaac Parker. The land was to be used for as building 
                site for a schoolhouse for District #12. The town paid the Parker's

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">David Lund 
                  was commissioned to construct the schoolhouse. A one-room schoolhouse 
                  in the Vernacular Greek Revival style was built. The clapboard 
                  structure rests on a granite foundation and has a low pitched 
                  gable front facing the road. Granite steps lead to the front 
                  door.</font></p>

                  was finished in time for the winter session of 1847. The first 
                  teacher was the Reverend S. Dodge. He taught thirty pupils for 
                  a total of 8 weeks and received $15.00 for his services. In 
                  the annual report of the Superintendent of Schools, #12 schoolhouse 
                  was described as follows:</font></p>

                  construction is tasteful and convenient. The facilities for 
                  warming and ventilating are such as we should be glad to see 
                  in every school house. They had their first school the past 
                  winter, which numbered 30 scholars.</i>&quot;</font></p>

                  and a winter session of 8 1/2 weeks with 25 students were held. 
                  Miss Catherine Carter and Miss Lucy D. Toleman were the teacher 
                  for the two sessions.</font></p>

                  female teachers were paid $5.00 per session and male teachers 
                  were paid $10.00. By 1853 this payment had doubled. Teachers 
                  often received room and board at one or more of the homes in 
                  the district.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">School was 
                  not held in the spring or fall because the children were needed 
                  to help with the planting and harvesting on the farms. Merrimack 
                  was still a farming community at this time.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most of 
                  the pupils were girls and few were over the age of fourteen 
                  years. The school day started with one of the older boys starting 
                  a fire in the wood stove and filling the water jug.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The wood 
                  stove was situated at the front of the building and the stove 
                  pipe ran across the length of the building to the chimney in 
                  the back. This was done to provide heat from the pipe as well 
                  as from the stove. There was no indoor plumbing until the year 
                  2000. Electricity was not installed until 1931.</font></p>

                  committee noticed three things in connection with this school, 
                  which they regard as constituting the necessary elements of 
                  a good school. First, a good teacher; second, a well constructed 
                  school-house; and last, but not least, good scholars</i>.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;<i>This 
                  district has the best house in town, and the only one warmed 
                  and ventilated upon correct philosophical principles. The only 
                  fault in the construction is this - that the writing benches 
                  are too far from the seats</i>.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reading 
                  writing and arithmetic were taught to grades one through eight 
                  by one teacher with the older children often helping the younger 
                  ones. In the 1860s geography was added to the curriculum and 
                  a set of Fowle's maps were purchased.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was 
                  no library and no reference books. The students bought their 
                  own books, and the teachers sometimes purchased extra teaching 
                  materials. Common books used for teaching were: Towne's and 
                  Holebrook's Progressive Readers, Greenleaf's National Arithmetic, 
                  Well's Grammar, Town's Speller and Definer and of course the 
                  Bible. District #12 schoolhouse did have a blackboard.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">History 
                  was later added to the list of subjects with Goodrich's History 
                  being added to the list of books. Music was not added until 
                  1947.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There were 
                  few extra books, little blackboard space and no repairs done 
                  to the schoolhouse in the 1850s and 18670s. The average class 
                  consisted of twenty pupils. Teacher salaries were between $8.00 
                  and $20.00, depending on the length of the term. Parents of 
                  the students provided wood for the stove and the older boys 
                  did the janitorial work.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With declining 
                  enrollment and the schoolhouse in some disrepair, the #12 schoolhouse 
                  was closed in 1906 and students attended Schoolhouse #5 until 
                  1910.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Few records 
                  for individual schools for the 1900s were found. In 1923, the 
                  #12 school was commended by Superintendent Louis Dewitt as follows:</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;<i>Although 
                  it is contrary to my custom to especially commend any teacher 
                  or school, I wish to call you attention to the work being done 
                  in your #12 school. It is a pleasure to anyone, whether visitor 
                  or inspector, to look into the faces of the children of this 
                  school and observe the happy, contented, joyous spirit of the 
                  boys and girls. The room is always orderly, clean and attractive 
                  and the children busy. The results are such as would be expected 
                  under these circumstances. The continuous service of a conscientious, 
                  trained teacher is invaluable to the community</i>.&quot; -- 
                  Louis DeWitt, Supt. Of Schools, Union #27</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By 1944, 
                  there were problems at the No. 12 school. The school building 
                  was unsatisfactory and the Superintendent of Schools recommended 
                  a committee of concerned citizens be appointed to study the 
                  possibility of building a new two-room school. Nothing was done. 
                  In 1945 the situation became worse. The No. 5 school had been 
                  closed and the pupils transferred to No. 12. This caused overcrowding 
                  at the school and the recommendation was made to build a new 
                  school once again. A decision was made in 1947 to replace the 
                  school. A special appropriation for $11000 to erect a new school 
                  house at South Merrimack was made.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The citizens 
                  of South Merrimack felt that the community landmark should be 
                  preserved. A article appeared on the town warrant and a vote 
                  was taken to give the building to the Village of South Merrimack 
                  for a community house.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Community 
                  Association of South Merrimack was formed in 1948, and the building 
                  was sold to them. Reverend Charles Haynes donated the $1.00 
                  fee for its purchase.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whist parties, 
                  auctions, lawn parties and suppers, as well as meetings were 
                  held in the building by the Village Club. The Sportsmen's Club 
                  also met at the No. 12 Schoolhouse.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sometime 
                  in the late 1940s, the Community Club added two additions to 
                  the schoolhouse. A fully equipped kitchen was constructed and 
                  a garage/woodshed moved from the Hall's property and attached 
                  to the back of the building. Extensive repairs and renovations 
                  were done by the club in 1958. Four windows were removed, eight 
                  others were replaced. A new chimney was built, the old restroom 
                  became a closet, and a new restroom was built in the shed. New 
                  plasterboard and a new ceiling were installed.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The last 
                  meeting of the South Village Club was held in 1951. The following 
                  years found the building being used by various civic groups 
                  and private organizations.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1987, 
                  the building had been vacant for some time. The Community Club 
                  disbanded and the ownership reverted back to the Merrimack School 
                  District. The Merrimack Historical Society bought the building 
                  in 1988.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1989, 
                  the Historical Society formed a building committee to research 
                  all aspects of the property and estimate its potential. A master 
                  plan was compiled, and after much debate, it was decided to 
                  renovate the building and use it for meetings, research work, 
                  and to display the town's artifacts.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1992, 
                  most of the renovations were completed and the building opened 
                  to the public, with volunteers to staff it.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the present 
                  time, the No. 12 schoolhouse, home of the Merrimack Historical 
                  Society, has an extensive collection of historical and genealogical 
                  data on the town of Merrimack and houses many of the town's 
                  artifacts.</font></p>
